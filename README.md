## 👋 About Me
I am a motivated cybersecurity student currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in **Computer Security Technology** at **Farmingdale State College**.  
My academic focus, combined with hands-on experience as a **Security Guard at Northwell Health**, has strengthened my awareness of security operations and the importance of protecting both people and information.  
I am also completing the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** and the **IBM IT Support Specialist program**, which have built my skills in network defense, incident response, and security tools.  

My goal is to begin my career as an **entry-level cybersecurity analyst or IT support technician**, where I can apply my technical knowledge to identify threats and safeguard organizational systems.  
I value **continuous learning, teamwork, and ethical responsibility**, and I’m passionate about helping organizations create safer digital environments for everyone.
